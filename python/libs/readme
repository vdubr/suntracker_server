1) git clone
2) move to timetracker folder by cd timetracker/
1) save dem for location from http://data.eox.at/eudem/ (or other source)
   Consider right area of your dem, you need much larger DEM for best precise
   computation of shade in your interested area.
2) move dem to folder ./processingSettings/[name of region]/dem.tiff
3) define area which you want to export to geojson http://geojson.io/
4) move geojson to folder./processingSettings/[name of region]/extent.geojson
5) Inport DEM and extent by running command:
    python python/libs/inport.py -p [name of region]
6) Open calculateShadow.py in folder python/libs/ and set year,hours,minutes
   for you want to calculate shadows
7) Compute shadows for days by run command:
    python python/libs/calculateShadow.py -s "2,1" -t "2,2" -p aprica
   It create new folder in timetracker folder with shadows, sun and region

8) For analyze resort inport corine tif to GRASS to same location under name corine
9) Digitalise resort area and slopes and save them in shapefile format
   to folder ./processingSettings/[name of region]/slope.shp && outline.shp
10) Inport slopes and resort by running script:
      python python/libs/inportSlopes.py -p [name of region]
11) Compute analyzes by running script:
      python python/libs/analyzeResort.py -p [name of region]
    It prepare file in [name of region]/region with statistics for resort region
12) Prepare API for mobile application by running:
      python python/libs/api.py -p [name of region] -n [name of Ski resort]
